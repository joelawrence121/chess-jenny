# chess-jenny
## Overview 
Chess jenny (chess generator) is designed to create and persist Chess puzzles. It's a script that runs Stockfish against itself indefinitely monitoring the game for certain criteria. 
Currently the types of puzzles it generates are: 
* Spot the killer move (extend an advantage significantly) 
* Spot the swing move (turn a disadvantage to an advantage) 
* Mate in N scenarios   

Work in progress
